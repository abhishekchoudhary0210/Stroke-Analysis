# Healthcare Stroke Analysis 🏥💉

## Dataset 📊
The dataset contains healthcare records related to stroke patients, including demographic and health-related features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and stroke occurrence. The goal is to analyze this dataset to derive meaningful insights into stroke risk factors.

## Project Overview 📝

### 1. Dataset Processing 🛠️
- **Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.**
- **Handle missing values appropriately.**
- **Convert categorical data into numerical format if needed.**
- **Normalize or scale numerical features where necessary.**
- **Prepare the cleaned dataset for analysis.**

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
- **Compute summary statistics for numerical columns.**
- **Identify correlations between features and stroke occurrence.**
- **Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.**
- **Analyze trends and distributions of key features.**

### 3. Demographic Analysis 👥
- **Identify the distribution of stroke patients by age, gender, and other relevant demographic factors.**
- **Create visualizations such as pie charts or bar plots.**
- **Find out which age group is most prone to strokes.**

### 4. Risk Factor Analysis ⚠️
- **Analyze features like hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and smoking status.**
- **Compare the stroke occurrence between different risk factor groups.**
- **Use statistical tests to determine significant risk factors.**

### 5. Trend Analysis 📈
- **Explore relationships between stroke occurrences and other health factors.**
- **Use data visualization techniques to illustrate these trends.**

### 6. Data Aggregation and Grouping 📊
- **Aggregate stroke rates by gender, age groups, or other categories.**
- **Analyze average BMI, glucose levels, and other health parameters for different groups.**
- **Present the findings in tabular and graphical formats.**

### 7. SQL Database Integration 🗃️
- **Store the cleaned data in an SQL database.**
- **Create an SQL database and relevant tables.**
- **Load the cleaned dataset into the database.**
- **Perform SQL queries to extract insights.**

### 8. Power BI Dashboard 📉
- **Load the dataset into Power BI.**
- **Design a dashboard to visualize key insights.**
- **Ensure the dashboard is interactive and informative.**

## Tools and Technologies Used 🛠️💻
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 🐍
- **SQL:** MySQL/PostgreSQL for data storage and queries 🗃️
- **Power BI:** Dashboard creation and visualization 📊
- **Jupyter Notebook/VS Code:** For data analysis and scripting 📓
